I designed the schematic today, the IC I am using is the [CoreChips SL2.1A](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/USB-HUB-Controllers_CoreChips-SL2-1A_C192893.html), it supports up to 4 extra USB connection.

I also added a diode at 5V input from the USB-A male connector to prevent backpower.

I originally chose a USB-A female connector that have 2 ports, but I realised that might be too heavy and might break the USB port on my laptop.

So I chose one with only 1 port and used 4 of them.
